I am final year Btech student at [VIT Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/) studying Computer Science. Passionate about AI and machine learning and tech as a whole and I hope to contribute to the cutting-edge of these technologies.

Open to new oppurtunities in these fields and meeting new people and learning from them.
